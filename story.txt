# A Day at Schloss Eltz

It was a crisp morning when Anna and Melhase decided ton visit Schloss Eltz, a beautiful castle in Germany. On there way, they met a Kugelrund man eating Apfelkuchen.
The man offered them a bite, and as they politely declined, he exclaimed, “You must try the Bratwurst at the Biergarten instead it’s legendary!”. Melhase again politely declined saying "I prefer the Baeckerei!" and began walking quickly.
